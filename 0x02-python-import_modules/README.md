Why Python Programming is Awesome
Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Its strengths include a large standard library, cross-platform compatibility, a supportive community, and its applicability to a wide range of fields including web development, data science, automation, and more.

How to Import Functions from Another File
You can import functions from one Python file into another using the import statement. This allows you to reuse code across multiple files and projects. 

How to Use Imported Functions
Once you've imported a function, you can use it just like any other function. 

How to Create a Module
A module is a Python file containing functions, classes, or variables. To create a module, simply create a .py file with the code you want to package. eg creating a module named my_module would involve creating a file named my_module.py.

How to Use the Built-in Function dir()
The dir() function allows you to list the names in the current scope or the valid attributes and methods for an object.

How to Prevent Code in Your Script from Being Executed when Imported
Use the __name__ variable to prevent specific code from running when a module is imported. This helps you control execution.

How to Use Command Line Arguments with Your Python Programs
You can access command line arguments using the sys.argv list from the sys module.
