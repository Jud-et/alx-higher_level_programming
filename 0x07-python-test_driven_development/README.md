0x07. Python - Test-driven Development
Welcome to the module of our Python series! In this module, we will delve into Test-driven Development (TDD) using Python. TDD is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This approach has numerous benefits, and we'll explore why Python is an excellent choice for implementing TDD.

..Why Python Programming is Awesome
Python is an awesome language for Test-driven Development due to its simplicity and readability. Here are some reasons why Python is a great choice:

Readability: Python's clean and easily readable syntax makes it ideal for writing test cases and code. Tests are often written in a format that closely resembles natural language, enhancing clarity.

Vast Standard Library: Python's extensive standard library provides a wealth of modules and functions, making it easier to test various aspects of your code without needing external libraries.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is cross-platform, ensuring that your tests are consistent across different operating systems.

Community and Ecosystem: Python boasts a vibrant community and a rich ecosystem of testing frameworks and tools, such as unittest, pytest, and doctest, to streamline TDD.

..What's an Interactive Test
Interactive tests are a crucial part of the TDD process. They allow you to experiment with your code and verify its functionality in an interactive manner. Interactive tests can be run quickly, providing rapid feedback during development.

..Why Tests are Important
Tests serve several essential purposes:

Verification: Tests verify that your code behaves as expected, helping you catch bugs early in the development process.

Documentation: Well-written tests serve as living documentation, providing examples of how to use your code.

Refactoring Safety Net: Tests ensure that your code maintains functionality when making changes or refactoring existing code.

..How to Write Docstrings to Create Tests
Docstrings are used to provide documentation within your Python code. In TDD, you can use docstrings to describe what a particular function or module should do. These docstrings then serve as a basis for writing tests.

..How to Write Documentation for Each Module and Function
Writing documentation is an essential part of good coding practices. Use tools like Sphinx to generate documentation from your docstrings. Proper documentation helps users understand how to use your code and facilitates collaboration with other developers.
