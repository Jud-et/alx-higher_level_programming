0x0A. Python - Inheritance
General
>Why Python Programming is Awesome
Python is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's extensive standard library provides modules and packages for various tasks, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
>What is a Superclass, Base Class, or Parent Class
A superclass, base class, or parent class in object-oriented programming is a class that is extended or inherited by one or more subclasses. It contains common attributes and methods that can be reused by its subclasses. Superclasses provide a blueprint for creating more specialized classes.

>What is a Subclass
A subclass is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a superclass or base class. It can extend or customize the behavior of the superclass, as well as add its own unique attributes and methods. Subclasses allow for code reuse and specialization.

>How to list all Attributes and Methods of a Class or Instance
Python provides introspection capabilities that allow you to dynamically inspect and retrieve information about a class or an instance at runtime. This includes listing all the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) associated with a class or an instance.

>When Can an Instance Have New Attributes
In Python, you can dynamically add new attributes to an instance at runtime. This flexibility allows you to customize individual instances of a class with additional data or behavior that may not be present in the class definition itself.

>How to Inherit a Class from Another
Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming where a class (subclass) can acquire the attributes and methods of another class (superclass or base class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.

>How to Define a Class with Multiple Base Classes
Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one base class. This can be useful in situations where a class needs to combine functionality from different sources.

>What is the Default Class Every Class Inherits From
In Python, every class implicitly inherits from a built-in class called object. This is the ultimate base class for all classes in Python. It provides default implementations for common methods like __str__, __repr__, and others.

>How to Override a Method or Attribute Inherited from the Base Class
Method overriding is the process of providing a new implementation for a method that is inherited from a base class. This allows a subclass to customize the behavior of a method without modifying the original implementation in the base class.

>Which Attributes or Methods Are Available by Heritage to Subclasses
When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it gains access to all the attributes and methods of the superclass. These inherited attributes and methods become part of the subclass's own set of attributes and methods, which it can use or override.

>What is the Purpose of Inheritance
The primary purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse and modularity. It allows you to define common behavior in a base class and then customize or extend that behavior in subclasses. This reduces redundancy and makes code more organized and maintainable.

>What are, When, and How to Use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super Built-in Functions
These are built-in functions in Python that facilitate various aspects of object-oriented programming:
..isinstance: Checks if an object belongs to a specified class or its subclass. It helps in type checking and handling different types of objects in a flexible manner.
..issubclass: Checks if a class is a subclass of another class. It's used for analyzing class relationships in inheritance hierarchies.
..type: Returns the type of an object. It's commonly used for type checking and introspection.
..super: Provides a way to call methods from a superclass within a subclass. It's used for accessing and customizing inherited behavior.

These functions play a crucial role in managing class relationships, checking object types, and customizing behavior in object-oriented programming.
Happy coding!!
